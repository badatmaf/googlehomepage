The Odin Project-googlehomepage project__
What I've learned:__

finally getting know the difference between padding and margin!__
front-end is not for me (probably, though I have enjoyed this project)__
You can say that my CSS understanding/skills "exists"__

What I could have done better:__

sizing/spacing of the elements relative to the page size__
hover effect over the search bar__
sizing and spacing of images__
some spacing of elements in general.__
