The Odin Project-googlehomepage project

What I've learned:

-finally getting know the difference between padding and margin!\
-front-end is not for me (probably, though I have enjoyed this project)\
-You can say that my CSS understanding/skills "exists"

What I could have done better:

-sizing/spacing of the elements relative to the page size\
-hover effect over the search bar\
-sizing and spacing of images\
-some spacing of elements in general.
